# Mission
Our overarching aim is to build technical and
social capacity among community-curated data repositories by supporting technical
implementation of ethical open science (OS) principles and developing communities of practice focused on CARE (collective benefit, authority to control, responsible, and ethical) and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principles.
